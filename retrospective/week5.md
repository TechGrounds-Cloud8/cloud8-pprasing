Everybody: Use 10 minutes to answer the given questions. Write the answer down.

## What went well?
 - Recap of what i already learned went really well , i tried a new way of going trough the video materials, by adjusting the speed from 1.0 to 1.5 - 1.75. So basically fast forwarding things that i already knew and slowing the video down when i noticed i was forgotten a certain subject
 - did all the knowlegde checks needed for the material and passed.  

## What could have gone better?
 - This friday i was planning to take a practice exam to so see what my score would be now. Unfortunately i was surprised that i had to do a presentation today about Elastic Beanstalk. So i learned alot about this topic today, which was good but for next week i will try to do the practice exam earlier to check up on my score and what i have to learn better

## What can we do to improve?
 - What could have been better was the scheduling and clarification what to do on the friday. Everybody understood that there would not be any presentation. Thats why my planning for the total friday was interupted.
