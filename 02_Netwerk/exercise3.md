### Results 2
Mainly we can split up the protocols in 
- standard protocols are developed by a group of experts from different organisations
    - some examples : ftp, dns, dhcp, smtp, telnet and ;
- proprietary protocols are developed by an individual organization for their specific devices 
    - some examples : imessage, apple talk

For creating your own protocol it is neccesary 
- Set of procedures for handshaking
- Set of rules for interpreting the data sent
- Steps for recovery if communication is broken in the middle.
