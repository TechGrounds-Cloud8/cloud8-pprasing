# [Processes]
I need to install telnet on the techground server, make a connection and see what the PID is. i should also know how to close it
Telnet is an old way of communicating to a server, but is not secure. Instead it would be better to use for example powershell, while this is secure


## Key terminology
- PID = process identification number , each command is interpreted by the system as a new process
- telnet = old way of communicating to a server
