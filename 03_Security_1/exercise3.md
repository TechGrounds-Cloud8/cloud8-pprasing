# [Identity and Access Management]



## Key terminology
- authentication: authenticate is check to to see if you are who you say you are. 
- authorisation: what right does a user has , what can the user do
- MFA: Multi Factor Authentication, security check with an extra checkup like password, google authenticator, SMS, biometrical etc...
- principle of least privilege for authorization: give only access to a user for what he needs to see or do and block the rest.

## Exercise
In this exercise we are learning what the possibilities are to secure your useraccount with extra security measures. And how can you reduce the chance of security issues with authorisations and restrictions.

### Overcome challanges
No challenges

### Results
- Difference between authentication and authorization is that with the authentication you check up on the person if he is the actual person that he says that he is . With the authorisation settings are beiing set up what that specific user is aloud to do within the system or with documents.

- What are the 3 factors of authentication 
    - Something you know (such as a password)
    - Something you have (such as a smart card or online authenticator)
    - Something you are (such as a fingerprint or other biometric method)
    With the use of MFA there needs to be a minimum of 2 factors with a different category of authentication to improve security

- Principle of least privilege is assigning the only nessecary access to files and systems that is needed for a specific user or group. With the creation of an user account everything should be blocked unless you give access to it
